# Enrol-POI-Classification
I have used various Machine Learning algorithms over the [Enron Dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/) and analzed their performance after parameter tuning .

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook Enron Email POI classification.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook Enron Email POI classification.ipynb
```



## TODO:
1. Add XGboost
2. Perform Recursive feature Selection
3. Add Graph for feature analysis
4. Add more ensemble methods
